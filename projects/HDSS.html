            A game that I started making alone, and then brought a team that I wanted to be perfect.<br>
            I invited Ordinary User, Alive, Rukuto and Capitaine_fr on this project.<br>
            When they were invited, I already had a working first version with a character and some test items.<br>
            Everything seemed to start really well !<br>
            But no one was ambitious about this. No one was working, and I myself stopped working on it.<br>
            One day, everyone started leaving the team, leaving only myself with the messages, the first builds, and the source code.
        </p>
        <br>

            This game was meant to be pretty similar to OMORI, with some elements from Yume Nikki,<br>
            but with my own thoughts, to share what I could feel and think.
