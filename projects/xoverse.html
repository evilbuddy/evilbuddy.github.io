        <p>The R-J45 was a team originally founded by Evil Buddy and Ordinary User.<br>
        Quickly, we were joined by Rukuto, and the team was renamed to RJV.<br>
        We then needed more people, so we rebranded our team as "Xoverse", and got way more people in !<br>
        In the end, the team was composed of 6 persons, like so:</p>

        <h3>Devs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ordinary User (previously Akii)</li>
            <li>Evil Buddy</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Graphists</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rukuto</li>
            <li>Kanime</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sound Designers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Alive</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Testers (and moral support)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Capitaine_fr</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I am really happy this could exist. We still sometimes talk, and this team was just amazing !<br>
        But it slowly died, as we did not have any doable projects, and we didn't have enough skills either (especially me).<br>
        The website is under artificial breatinh rn, and is available <a href="https://xoverse.alwaysdata.net">here (V6)</a><br>
        If I can, I will try to find older versions of the website, and maybe make them public.<br>
        <a href="https://github.com/xoverse">Our GitHub</a> is still up, and our public repos are still there.</p>
        <p>(btw this dogshit theme is a reference to an old version of our website) ❤️ love y'all</p>
